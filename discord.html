					I am a third-year undergraduate student at the SFU’s School of Interactive Arts and
					Technology (SIAT) with a focus on user experience (UX) design and frontend
					development. I initially studied economics at SFU, which has equipped me with problem
					solving and critical thinking skills that I am able to apply to creative design problems.
					Design interests me because it challenges me to understand and seek ways to
					improve the relationship between products and people. I seek to combine technical
					skills in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Maya, HTML, CSS and JavaScript with knowledge
					of UX and visual design to help complex problems become simple solutions that
					people can understand.

					<p class="project-text">
						This was a two week long solo project in which I was tasked with adding a feature in the Discord
						application and showcasing the feature through an interactive prototype. Discord is a
						platform which allows voice and text communication between users and is especially
						favored by people playing computer games. A driving concept that I had in mind when
						ideating was to ensure that the implemented feature aligned with Discord’s platform
						and targeted user base.

					<h3 class="project-page-title">User Base</h3>
					<p class="project-text">
						The first step was to research the primary audience of Discord and what separates
						them from their competition. Similar text and voice chat applications failed to cater to
						the video game market, and Discord capitalized on this by making a communication
						platform that was much faster than competitors such as Skype.

					<h3 class="project-page-title">Feature Implementation</h3>
					<p class="project-text">
						The feature that I ultimately implemented within Discord allows users to rate and review
						video games and allow friends to see. This rating system is more user-specific than
						searching reviews on the web is because the online reviewers may have different
						preferences in the type of games they play as well as a different skill level. Friends are
						more likely to know each other’s skill level as well as the preferred game genre of the
						individual. In addition, the review feature aligns with Discord’s platform because it
						emphasizes helping gamers connect and play together.

					<h3 class="project-page-title">Outcome</h3>
					<p class="project-text">
						One of the most important aspects I learned from this project was how crucial the initial
						research phase is and understanding the targeted user base. Because I researched
						and understood who Discord primarily targets, when ideating and designing the feature
						I was able to create a meaningful feature that could be implemented in the application.
