					<p class="project-text">
						Seoul is a one week project with the intent to research the South Korean city of
						Seoul during the transformation from the industrial to the post-industrial era, and to
						investigate how the urban space and architecture of the city was designed to
						accompany the shift. In a team of five, the research was presented in the form of a slide deck to gain an
						understanding of the interactions Seoul’s environment makes with people of the city and to explore
						designing visual elements that match Seoul’s style.

					<h3 class="project-page-title">Concept</h3>
					<p class="project-text">
						My role was to create a concept to drive the art direction and research as
						well creating visual design elements of the slide deck presentation using adobe photoshop and
						illustrator. The concept of the project was that Seoul is a city with a soul, it is a living
						organism that is constantly changing the ways people interact with the city.
						Cheonggyecheon and Seoullo 7017 are architectural redevelopment projects that have
						brought people friendly spaces into the city to move away from the vehicle heavy
						industrial era.

						Two of Seoul’s architectural redevelopments were investigated; Cheonggyecheon river
						and the Seoullo 7017 sky garden. These architectural redevelopment projects softened
						the industrial infrastructure to help the city be more environmentally friendly and
						engaging with the people from the city.

					<h3 class="project-page-title">Outcome and Challenges</h3>
					<p class="project-text">
						A challenge that arose when creating the visual design of the slide deck was that the
						city and its architectural elements look much different in the day than at night. During
						the day, the natural light fills the street with people, and at night the lights built into the
						architecture light up the city with neon colors. Figure 6 is a mood board created which
						provided inspiration as well as an art direction to follow throughout the slide deck.
						Though, one aspect the city at day and night share is the life and energy that are
						brought to the city and the city’s people. The visual design of the slide deck reflects the
						contrast of Seoul in the day with the colorful city lights at night by establishing hierarchy
						in the slide’s elements using transparency and color.
